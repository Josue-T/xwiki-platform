--module=xwiki

## Default configuration values for XWiki

## Disable WAR scanning and hot deployments since we use static expanded WAR to speed up Jetty.
jetty.deploy.scanInterval=0
jetty.deploy.extractWars=false

## Jetty has added a protection in URLs so that encoded characters such as % are prohibited by default. Since
## XWiki uses them, we need to configure Jetty to allow for it. See
##   https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/jetty-10/operations-guide/index.html#og-module-server-compliance
## Since Jetty 12, using a URI compliance of just RFC3986 is no longer enough, we also need to relax some extra
## rules.
##   Remove AMBIGUOUS_PATH_ENCODING when https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22422 is fixed.
##   Remove AMBIGUOUS_EMPTY_SEGMENT when https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22428 is fixed.
##   Remove AMBIGUOUS_PATH_SEPARATOR when https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22435 is fixed.
